## Overview
- This Java program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles. It uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the Sudoku board with valid numbers. The recent update allows users to input their own Sudoku puzzle, rather than using a pre-defined board.

## Features

- **Sudoku Solver**: The program solves the input Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- **Board Validation**: Ensures that user inputs are within the valid range (0 to 9).
